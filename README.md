#  Exploring Factors That Impact Median Listing Prices for Homes In USA:

## Objective:

Since the COVID-19 Pandemic, housing prices have skyrocketed or pummeled in certain areas. With the rise of remote work, many individuals have moved away from areas closer to their workplaces, or have used the pandemic as an opportunity to move elsewhere. It is hard to watch the news without housing prices being mentioned. As a homeowner myself, I wanted to explore what factors impact the overall cost of a house. After doing some research I decided to explore factors including walkability, access to public transportation, unemployment rates, and overall happiness/quality of life in an area. Furthermore, I wanted to explore another factor that was linked to house-value by the University of Washington School of Public Health and that is obesity rates.

## Summary and Findings: 

### Walk Score and Transit Score:

Below is a graph highlighting the range of walk scores across different states taking population into consideration. As we can see, New York has one of the highest walk scores in the nation, followed by other states such as California. NYC is known internationally as a tourist hub and emphasizes public transportation. Furthermore, since NY has densely packed cities such as Brooklyn, NYC, and Queens. All of these cities, emphasize the usage of public transport and walking as a means of transportation. Studies have shown that millenials are less interested in cars that previous generations and are more likely to use mass transit and live in an area where it is easy to walk to a destination. Millenials represent 43% of homebuyers in the market -- the highest share of any generation (source: National Association of Realtors). Since millenials tend to gravitate to areas with mass-transport and ease of walkability, this factor may play a role in house prices as a large share of homebuyers are looking in a market that emphaisizes walkability and transit. From general knowledge, many people know that New York has a high cost of living and a high walk score as well as transit score as highlighted in the graph. 

### Obesity Rates in America:

A study done by researchers at the University of Washing School of Public Health discovered a strong association between home values and obesity among women in Seattle and its suburbs. Using this study, obesity rates in both adult male and females were used as a parameter to check if this correlation was seen on a national level. 

### Unemployment Rates in America:

A significant factor that highlights the economy of a state and nation is the unemployment rate. Many studies have shown that a higher unemployment rate is associated with lower housing prices, hence it is used as a parameter in this study to analyze the correlation between the two.  

### Happiness Index Across States:

Quality of life is an important parameter before settling on buying a house. Quality of life is dependent on many parameter such work environment, communities, and the environment. The Happiness Index is a comprehensive survey instrument that assesses happiness, wellbeing, and aspects of sustainability and resilience. It is an important system that is used to correlate other life factors. In this analysis, the happiness index was analyzed across states to determine any correlation between a high total score on the index and any affect it has on the median homevalue prices in the nation. 

### Correlation Matrices Between Parameters and Home List Prices:

Below, I produced correlation matrices between the median list prices of homes and varying parameters to explore how strong the correlation is between the two datasets. From the results we can see that the parameters that were explored above have low correlation scores when comparing its affects on list prices. 

There are many factors that play significant and or minor roles in the list price of homes. In this analysis I concluded that the parameters that were explored did not play a significant role in affecting the overall median list price of homes. To better improve this study, neighboring home list prices and historic property value should be evaluated as parameters that may produce a strong correlation value. Despite the fact that the analyzed factors do not play a significant role, it is important to highlight that parameters such as walkability, quality of life, and access to public transportation do have a positive correlation when it comes to the median list prices. It is also important to note that working with a larger dataset may help identify the same parameters with different correlation values. In particular, many studies have found that there is a moderately strong negative correlation between unemployment rates and housing prices. In this analysis, we also concluded that unemployment rates and median housing list prices had a negative correlation however the value was low. In future studies, instead of list prices, closing prices should be analyzed.
